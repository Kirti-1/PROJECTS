/**


Domino & Tromino Tiling
We have two types of tiles: a 2x1 domino shape, and an "L" tromino shape. These shapes may be rotated.

XX <- domino

XX <- "L" tromino
X

Given N, how many ways are there to tile a 2 x N board?

(In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.)

Input Format

A number n

Constraints

N will be in range 1 to 20
