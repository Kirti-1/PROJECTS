Java is peculiar as it expect a boolean value in "if" condition
        "int" can't be converted to boolean and "if" expects a boolean value
        You can't convert as this is a lossy conversion, we're losing value after point value
        it requires explicit conversion


/*
        String []st  = "102034".split("");
        for(String s:st){
            System.out.println(s);
        }
        */
