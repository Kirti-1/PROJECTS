__LINKED LIST__

```Java
public class ListNode{
    public int data;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int data){
        this.data = data;
        next = null;
    }
}
```

>This above line of code is declaration of LinkedList Node, A Linked list is one of the Data Structure used in order to overcome various drawbacks of using array as a data structure, there are various scenerios where linked list also turned out to be time consuming, but the main concern of the limit of the data that can be inputed is taken care of, now the user doesn't have to provide the number of data that they want to enter before hand, which is big win!
